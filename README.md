## Technologies

Snacc is created by using React/Redux for the client side and Rails/Postgresql on the server side. Rails Action Cables were used to implement live chat.

## Features

Snacc gives you the option to create a channel or a direct message group. You can select members for a channel through a list. If no members are selected, the channel created will have you as the only member by default. Live chatting is implemented inside each channel. While you're in a channel, messages change in real-time. You can also edit your own messages by double-clicking them. This feature is disabled if you're trying to update another person's message.
